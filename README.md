This repository stores code used in the analysis of the MLB Action Index (the number of balls in play
per game over a 162 game-season) presented at 2022 Sabr Case Competition. This code (along with additional
analyses done by other members of the Tufts Baseball Analytics Team) earned 1st place at the 2022 Sabr
conference. 

Specifically, the code in this repsitory analyses the effects of moving the pitchers mound back (which
would decrease the effective velocity of a fastball) and the impact this would have on the MLB action index.
This analysis also considers the kinematics of a baseball pitch and proposes an adjustment to the strike zone
(of approxiately 1.75 inches) in order to account for a larger time where the force of gravity can act on the
pitch. Through this analytical framework, we propose that moving the mound back by 2 feet could return the MLB
Action Index to early 2000s (2009 in particular) levels.
